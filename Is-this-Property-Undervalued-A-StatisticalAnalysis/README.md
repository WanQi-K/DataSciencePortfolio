## Summary:
This project explores the California Housing Dataset and applies linear regression to predict housing prices. It also draws parallels with real-world applications in analyzing property prices in the Malaysian property market using machine learning.

## California Housing Project Highlights:
Data Cleaning: Addressed outliers, applied transformations, and standardized features.
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Used correlation analysis and visualizations to identify key predictive features.
Model Building: Linear regression implementation with performance metrics like RÂ², RMSE, and MAE to evaluate accuracy.
Real-Life Application: Demonstrated actionable insights by predicting property prices and assessing confidence intervals.
Malaysian Property Market Analysis:
Objective: Assess whether property listings are overpriced, underpriced, or fairly priced based on predictions from a machine learning model.
