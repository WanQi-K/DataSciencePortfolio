# California Housing Linear Regression with sklearn

**### Intro : sklearn dataset
This dataset is perfect for beginners because it includes real-world data, is well-structured, and allows for exploring different preprocessing and modeling techniques. It can also be imported directly from sklearn library.
In this project, I leveraged Python and linear regression to build a model capable of predicting median housing prices in California. Using machine learning, I demonstrated how data insights could guide real-life decisions, such as determining a fair price for a home based on its features.

## Data Preparation
To begin, I imported the necessary libraries and loaded the California Housing Dataset from sklearn. This dataset includes various features like median income, average room count, and geographic details to predict median house values. I also formatted numerical outputs to display with two decimal places for easier readability. **
