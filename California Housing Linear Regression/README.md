# California Housing Linear Regression with sklearn

### Intro : sklearn dataset
This dataset is perfect for beginners because it includes real-world data, is well-structured, and allows for exploring different preprocessing and modeling techniques. It can also be imported directly from sklearn library.
In this project, I leveraged Python and linear regression to build a model capable of predicting median housing prices in California. Using machine learning, I demonstrated how data insights could guide real-life decisions, such as determining a fair price for a home based on its features.
