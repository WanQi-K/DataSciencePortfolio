# California Housing Linear Regression withÂ sklearn

This project explores the California Housing Dataset using Python and linear regression to predict median house prices based on key features like income, house age, and location. Designed as a beginner-friendly tutorial, it demonstrates step-by-step how to clean and preprocess data, analyze correlations, and build a predictive model using sklearn.

Key highlights include:

Data Cleaning: Outlier removal, log transformation, and standardization.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Correlation analysis and visualizations to identify impactful features.

Model Building: Linear regression with evaluation metrics like R-squared, RMSE, and MAE.

Real-Life Application: Predicting housing prices with confidence intervals for actionable insights.

This repository is ideal for those looking to learn data preprocessing, build machine learning models, and apply them to real-world datasets. The full code and explanations are provided to guide beginners through the process.
