# Titanic Project with Logistic Regression

This project focuses on predicting Titanic passenger survival using logistic regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm for binary classification. The blog walks through the entire machine learning workflow, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, making it beginner-friendly.

Key Highlights:
Project Goal: Predict passenger survival (1 = Survived, 0 = Not Survived) based on features like class, age, sex, and fare using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
Feature Engineering: Includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for better model performance.
Model Training: Logistic regression was used as the primary model, achieving an average accuracy of 79% through cross-validation.
Evaluation: Explains the importance of cross-validation, model retraining, and splitting datasets to ensure robust predictions.
Takeaways: Emphasizes the importance of data preparation and cross-validation in creating effective machine learning models.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal for Learners: This project serves as a hands-on tutorial for beginners in machine learning, showcasing step-by-step implementation, best practices, and practical insights.

ðŸ’¡ Next Steps: Future improvements include testing advanced models (e.g., Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning, and incorporating additional features for better predictions.
